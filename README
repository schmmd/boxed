Boxed version 1.00
Copyright (c) 2005 Michael D. Schmitz

A clone of the good old Beasts game for the classic Macintosh.  Unfortunately,
the code is in somewhat of a disorder because this was written in late high
school when I really didn't know C++ (not that I do now).

This was written to run under Gnome on Linux.

Here is a blurb for the game:

    Cage the squirrels by pushing boxes around them. But beware: the 
    squirrels bite. As the levels increase not only do the squirrels 
    multiply, but they quicken and the boxes needed to confine them 
    become scarce!
